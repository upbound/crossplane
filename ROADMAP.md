# Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.
